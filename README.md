## Description
This app is used using ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to create a database for an eccomerce site! 
Users can create new, update, delete and see current data for their site using four main domains ( Category, Product, Product Tags, Tags). 
Since this is all backend code you will need to have Postman/Insomnia installed to make these requests.

## Installation
Please download the following on your command line "npm i dotenv express mysql2 nodemon sequelize". You will also need to install Postman to be able to make your requests.
Please enter into your code editor and make sure all your npm packages are installed. 
From there you will need to run "mysql -u root -p". Please drop the data base from the schema file. Please make sure to have updated your password in a .env file.
You will also need to source the schema.sql while on mysql and click into the ecommerce_db by first typing "GET tables;" then "use ecommerce_db". From there you can exit and
from the server you can run the seeds. After that you can launch to localhost using nodemon.
